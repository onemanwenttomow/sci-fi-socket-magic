# Socket Sci-Fi Magic

I built this project as a demo for when i teach sockets to students. The idea came from sci-fi shows such as the expanse where people "flick" items from their handheld devices to a larger screen. This project does the same thing, but is limited to Pokemon. 
## Demo

Give it 7 seconds to wake up on Heroku... You will need to open the site on both your desktop/laptop and your mobile. Then "flick" the pokemon up from the phone and they should appear on the desktop.
